Below is a general workflow for removing `pip` on a Mac. The exact steps will vary depending on **how** `pip` was installed (Homebrew, python.org installer, manual install via get-pip, etc.). If your machine has been compromised, you may wish to do a more thorough reinstallation of Python or even the entire system. But if you specifically want to remove `pip`, these steps should help:

---

## 1. Identify which Python and pip you’re dealing with

1. **Check which `pip` is being used**:
   ```bash
   which pip
   which pip3
   ```
   - This tells you the path of the `pip` (or `pip3`) executable.  
   - Typical paths might look like:
     - `/usr/local/bin/pip`
     - `/opt/homebrew/bin/pip`
     - A custom folder if the attacker placed it somewhere unusual.

2. **Find out the Python version behind it**:
   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```
   - This will output something like:
     ```
     pip 21.2.4 from /usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pip (python 3.9)
     ```
   - Note the directory: `/usr/local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/` (or similar). That’s where the `pip` files actually live.

3. **Confirm if Homebrew is involved**:
   - If you installed Python (and thereby pip) via [Homebrew](https://brew.sh):
     ```bash
     brew list | grep python
     ```
   - If you see something like `python@3.9` in the output, that means Homebrew is managing that Python (and its `pip`).

---

## 2. Remove pip if installed via Homebrew

- If Homebrew is managing your Python installation (and thus pip), the most straightforward way to remove pip is to remove that entire Python package. For example:

  ```bash
  brew uninstall python
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  brew uninstall python@3.9
  ```
  (substitute the actual version you found with `brew list` or `brew info python`).

- This will remove `python`, `pip`, `pip3` binaries installed in Homebrew’s prefix (often `/usr/local/` on Intel Macs or `/opt/homebrew/` on Apple Silicon Macs).

- You can then verify removal with:
  ```bash
  which pip
  which python
  ```
  They should no longer point to Homebrew paths.

---

## 3. Remove pip if installed via the python.org Installer

If Python came from the [python.org](https://python.org) macOS installer:

1. Look in **/Applications** for “Python 3.x” or a similar folder.
2. You can either:
   - **Uninstall the entire Python framework** (this removes the Python app, plus pip).  
   - Or remove only pip from that particular Python installation.  

### A) Full removal of that Python framework
- Typically, you’d move the “Python 3.x” folder from `/Applications` to the Trash, along with `/Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.x`.
- Then remove or rename any symlinks in `/usr/local/bin/` that point to that Python, e.g. `python3`, `pip3`, etc.

### B) Only remove pip from that Python
- Try:
  ```bash
  python3 -m pip uninstall pip
  ```
  or
  ```bash
  pip3 uninstall pip
  ```
  In many cases, however, pip is designed not to remove itself cleanly. You might see a warning or error because pip doesn’t like to uninstall itself. If it fails:

  1. Manually remove the pip package folder from site-packages. For example (based on the path you found from `pip --version`):
     ```bash
     rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.x/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pip
     rm -rf /Library/Frameworks/Python.framework/Versions/3.x/lib/python3.9/site-packages/pip-*.dist-info
     ```
  2. Remove the symlink or script for pip in `/usr/local/bin`, `/usr/bin`, or wherever it resides:
     ```bash
     sudo rm /usr/local/bin/pip
     sudo rm /usr/local/bin/pip3
     ```
     (Adjust paths to match what `which pip` returned.)

---

## 4. If `pip` was installed via get-pip.py or a malicious script

Some attackers may have used a manual script (like `get-pip.py`) to place pip on your system. In that case, you’ll want to:

1. **Locate the python site-packages** directory used by that script. You can see it from:
   ```bash
   pip --version
   ```
   or
   ```bash
   python -m site
   ```
2. **Delete the `pip` and any `pip-*.dist-info` folders** from that site-packages directory.
3. **Remove any leftover symlinks** for pip (e.g. `/usr/local/bin/pip`, or whichever path it had).
4. **Double check** there are no suspicious or extra Python installations in `/usr/local`, `/opt/local`, or in your user’s home directory. Attackers sometimes drop entire Python builds or virtual environments in hidden folders.

## 5. General Security Advice for a Compromised Mac

If the Mac is confirmed to be compromised (phished or otherwise), simply uninstalling pip may not be enough to fully secure the machine. Attackers could have:

- Left other malicious binaries or Python packages behind.
- Created malicious LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons to persist after reboots.
- Modified shell startup files (like `.bash_profile`, `.zshrc`) to load malicious scripts.

**Recommended additional steps**:

1. **Check for suspicious LaunchAgents/LaunchDaemons**:  
   Look in:
   - `~/Library/LaunchAgents/`
   - `/Library/LaunchAgents/`
   - `/Library/LaunchDaemons/`
   - `/System/Library/LaunchDaemons/`  
   Check for anything that doesn’t belong or is newly created.

2. **Check for unexpected cronjobs** (though less common in modern macOS):
   ```bash
   crontab -l
   sudo crontab -l
   ```
3. **Review login items** in **System Settings** → **General** → **Login Items**.

4. **Check shell startup files** (`~/.zshrc`, `~/.bash_profile`, etc.) for suspicious lines or script calls.

5. Consider running a known-good anti-malware tool or scanning from a separate drive.

6. If you suspect deep compromise, **a full OS reinstallation** (or restore from a known-clean backup) is the safest course.

---

## Summary

1. **Identify** the installation method (Homebrew, python.org, or other).
2. **Uninstall** that Python installation entirely if possible (the easiest, cleanest way to remove pip).
3. If you need to keep Python but remove just pip, manually delete:
   - The `pip` script(s) in `/usr/local/bin/`, `/usr/bin/`, or wherever they live.
   - The `pip` folder(s) in site-packages (where the actual code is).
4. **Hunt for other malicious artifacts** if the machine was truly compromised.

Following these steps should remove pip from your Mac. If you keep running into any errors or see new suspicious files reappearing, assume persistent malware and proceed with deeper forensic analysis or a full OS reinstall.
